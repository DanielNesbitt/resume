      \item Integrated new junior developers into the team in record time with direct mentoring
      \item Designed an all-encompassing solution that reduced user workflow times by 90\% by addressing issues beyond the functional requirements
      \item Implemented a plugin infrastructure for integrating new analysis options in Javascript
      \item Designed and provided technical oversight for the development of a web service layer as a Grails plugin for retrieving available data as JSON with API security

    \end{itemize}
  }
  \cventry{}{Software Engineer}{Genedata AG}{}{}{
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Wrote a class-loading infrastructure across RMI and JNLP for sandboxing class hierarchies derived from third party plugins which eliminated the unpredictable defects and costly workarounds caused by class shadowing issues
      \item Created an analysis for computing scoring for alternative splicing based on MiDAS method by Affymetrix with parallelism that scaled by 92\%
      \item Wrote a visualization for displaying a heat map of alternative splicing activity with associated gene expression profiles in Java2D
      \item Implemented a thread safe remote message condenser to avoid flooding client connections with pushed feedback
    \end{itemize}
  }
  \cventry{January 2010 -- December 2010}{Software Engineer}{BioInquire LLC}{}{}{
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Initiated the design and implementation of a new quantitation algorithm
      \item Reverse engineered and implemented a parser for a vendor file format avoiding the need to license a costly third party solution
      \item Designed a new save file format to reduce space on disk by 40\% for a medium sized project while increasing read/write efficiency
      \item Replaced an existing GUI model with an observer pattern based design to ensure consistent UI state
      \item Developed a workflow automation feature by providing command line processing for YAML based project configurations that were directly edited by end users
    \end{itemize}
